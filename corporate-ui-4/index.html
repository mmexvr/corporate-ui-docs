                  After months of work we have now release Scania Digital Design
                  System. With it comes several improvements based on feedback
                  and insights from the previous versions of Corporate UI. The
                  goal to deliver a consistent styling combined with reusable
                  components remains the same, but the way of achieving that
                  goal has received a few changes.

                <h3>Web components</h3>
                <p>
                  The most prominent change is to the technology used to create
                  Web components. In this version of Corporate UI it has been
                  decided to move away from Google Polymer to
                  <a
                    href="https://stenciljs.com/docs/introduction/"
                    target="_blank"
                    >StencilJS </a
                  >. The reason for this change is the request for a more
                  simple, lightweight and future proof Corporate UI by the
                  developer community. Stencil generates standard web component
                  that works in any framework or no framework at all. The logic
                  is now moved from the runtime to the compilation phase to
                  optimize load time. With this technology it is now possible to
                  import component as a module. In addition, web components now
                  available as self-contained components where the styling is
                  scoped within the components. More information about Web
                  components can be found in the
                  <a

                <h3>Removal of Bootstrap Upgrade</h3>
                <p>
                  We no longer support bootstrap as a core, instead we have
                  moved on to our own core to build components. Instead of
                  building everything around a bootstrap version, we decieded to
                  start our own solution.

                <h3>Breaking Changes</h3>
                <p>
                  SDDS have made big changes to the structure. Polymer is
                  replaced by Stencil to create Custom elements, Naming
                  convention of Custom elements like c-component has been
                  changed to sdds-component. So all component have the prefix of
                  "sdds-". Both webcomponents and css only.

                <h3>Distribution</h3>
                <p>
                  it is now possible to use SDDS as a package as it is available
                  in NPM. This will enable projects to host assets from
                  Corporate UI how they want without relying on an internet
                  connection. Furthermore it will add flexibility to how they
                  want to manipulate the package to fit their projectâ€™s needs.
