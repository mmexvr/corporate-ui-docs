<h1>The Corporate UI Framework</h1>

<p>In this repository you'll find all documentation of the components contained in <a href="https://github.com/Scania/corporate-ui"> repository.</a>.</p>

<h2>The Corporate UI Development Process</h2>
<p>There are many stakeholders that has interest in this library. Normally, new needs and improvements are filtered from business and end users via UX designers and product owners.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Once project requirements are defined: Is there any component that we can re-use?</li>
	<li>If not, is there any component that we can extend? Is there anyone else who's made a pull request for this kind of component?</li>
	<li>Otherwise, create a pull request and start develop the component.</li>
	<li>Push your code for review and then enjoy the limelight once your component is merged and released!</li>
</ul>
