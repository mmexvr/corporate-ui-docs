                  The new Scania user interface is now largely supplied as ready
                  to run web components. This means that you no longer has to
                  develop common elements like the header, main navigation or
                  the page footer. Filtered and sortable tables are available to
                  use straight of the shelf as well as a lot of other components
                  as well.

                <p>
                  By 2019, Chrome stop supporting some main features that is
                  used to build Corporate UI 3.x. With the development of web
                  component technology, an improved solution for Scania web
                  component collections is made by releasing

                  through the development of Scania Digital Design System. With
                  these situations, we plan to deprecate and stop support for
                  Corporate UI 3.5 and below.

                <h2>Motivation</h2>
                <p>
                  Corporate UI 3.5 is using Polymer v1 which built on top of Web
                  component v0 specs. Web component v0 specs are only available
                  in Chrome and polyfill is used for browser that not supports
                  v0 specs. In 2018, Chrome announced that they will remove Web
                  Component v0 features in Chrome v73 (released in April 2019).
                  Although, polyfill still can be used for application with v0
                  specs. One of the main feature in v0 is the use of HTML
                  Imports which is not adopted by other browser. Instead,
                  various browser engines adopted Web Component v1 specs.

                <p>
                  HTML Imports that is used in CUI v3.x and below was never
                  standardized and is not supported in major browsers. In the
                  development of SDDS, we focused on creating a solution which
                  will work with standard Javascript modules and following the
                  new Web Component v1 specs that are more widely used in
                  various browsers. Our focus is to develop a more easy to use,
                  framework-agnostic, and sustainable solution.
                </p>
                 
                <p>
                  With these reasons, we decided to deprecate support for CUI
                  v3.x and focus on improving SDDS to be more flexible and make
                  it available for wider usage.
                </p>

                <h2>Suggestion for developers</h2>
                <p>
                  If you have used Corporate UI version 3.x and below, thank you
                  so much!
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you have existing application using Corporate UI 2.x or
                  3.x, we strongly suggest you to migrate to SDDS.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Follow through our migration checklist :

                <p>
                  Although the application with Corporate UI v3.x or below might
                  still run with polyfill, it is not guaranteed it will work
                  properly in modern browser since the native features are
                  already removed in Chrome specification.

                <h2>Digital Design System Resources</h2>
                <p>
                  UX Library has provided valuable contents for users,
                  especially documentation for Corporate UI 3.x. Since then, we
                  tried to deliver a more stable design system. The new design
                  system has been released in Q1 2020 and we decided to merge UX
                  Library into the new site digitaldesign.scania.com by the end
                  of Q3 2021. We will move and improve relevant contents from UX
                  Library to digitaldesign.scania.com. Documentation and
                  resources will be available in digitaldesign.scania.com
                  website or under digitaldesign.scania.com domain.
